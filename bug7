Since every stream has an email address it is useful to use this feature to forward emails to a specific stream.
Usually emails are not written with markdown syntax in mind and the emails sometimes render in strange ways.
I think it would be a good idea to add a feature to disable the markdown render for the email gateway bot (emailgateway@zulip.com)
