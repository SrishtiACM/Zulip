Scenario:

Email Auth Enabled to Create Organisation
LDAP then enabled and tested, works fine.
Email Auth then disabled and server restarted.

However it still lets you register a user via email (who is none LDAP)
Sends confirmation email
Link in confirmation email will let them set a password and then log them in.
However if you log out and try logging back, auth will fail.

The registration by emails except those found in LDAP should be disabled whilst email auth is disabled.

Issue first reported by another user on chat.zulip.org, I replicated and got the same results.
