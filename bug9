I added a custom emoji in the Linux desktop app, and it worked fine. I then decided I didn't like it, deleted it. I then tried to add a different png of the same name and received an error: "Failed: Realm emoji with this Realm and Name already exists."

I then went to my web browser and logged in to my zulip instance from there. All is well. The unwanted emoji is gone and the new one is in place. It works just fine. The problem is simply that the desktop client gives a spurious error message.
